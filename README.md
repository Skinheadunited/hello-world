Testing github with their hello world tutorial

Hello! I am a 19 year (20 tomorrow) old guy that is into anime and video games. Currently watching Plastic memories and playing through Dark souls 2 before DS3 is realesd. I also have a intrest in programing. I have done a bit of it before, mostly c++ and a bit of html and css. My goal by using github is to become more understanding about programing and computers. I would like to get a fulltime job as a programer at some piont in the future. I also have dreams of making games, I always have. Gaming is something I have been doing my whole life. Probably to run away from reality as I never has had any confidence in my self. That was probably the reason I stared watching anime as well. I spend most of my time browsing 4chan nowdays. My parents always bug me about getting a job. I know I should be job hunting but I fucking can't. I always end up playing games and watching anime all day. I should just off myself and stop wasting precious oxygen, but I am to much of a pussy to actually do it. Mabye thats a good thing, I don't know. I want to get off the ride, but I probably never will.
